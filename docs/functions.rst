Custom Functions Modules
========================

You can write your own custom functions modules.

A function module is a regulare Python module containing Python functions with the following signature::

    def myfunction(environment, book, **kwargs)

Function must accept the ``environment`` and ``book`` positional arguments. After them, everything other argument is up the the function.

Another reuqirement is that the function must return a value wrapped into the environment's copy method::

    return environment.copy(my_return_value)

Function modules must be made available by adding them to the ``FUNCTION_MODULES`` :doc:`settings` variable.
