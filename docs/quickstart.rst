Quickstart
-----------

Run databuild using a :doc:`buildfile <buildfiles>`::

  $ data-build.py buildfile.json

``buildfile.yaml`` contains a list of operations to be performed on data. Think of it as a script for a spreadsheet.

An example of build file could be::

    - operation: sheets.import_data
      description: Importing data from csv file
      params: 
        sheet: dataset1
        format: csv
        filename: dataset1.csv
        skip_last_lines: 1
    - operation: columns.add_column
      description: Calculate the gender ratio
      params: 
        sheet: dataset1
        name: Gender Ratio
        expression: 
          language: python
          content: "return float(row['Totale Maschi']) / float(row['Totale Femmine'])"
    - operation: sheets.export_data
      description: save the data
      params: 
        sheet: dataset1
        format: csv
        filename: dataset2.csv

JSON buildfiles are also supported. ``Databuild`` will guess the type based on the extension.
