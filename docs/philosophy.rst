``Databuild`` is an alternative to more complex and complete packages.

It's aimed at users that are not necessarily data scientist and are looking to a simpler alternative to softwares such as ``pandas``, ``numpy``, and ``R``.

It's admittely less performant than them and is not optimized for huge datasets. But it's much easier to get started with.

The general principles in ``Databuild` are:

* Low entry barrier
* Easy to install
* Easy to grasp
* Extensible
