``Databuild`` is an alternative to more complex and complete packages like ``pandas``, ``numpy``, and ``R``.

It's aimed at users that are not necessarily data scientist and are looking to a simpler alternative to such softwares.

It's admittely less performant than those and is not optimized for huge datasets. But ``Databuild`` is much easier to get started with.

The general principles in ``Databuild`` are:

* Low entry barrier
* Easy to install
* Easy to grasp
* Extensible
